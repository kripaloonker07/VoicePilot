 **VOXCONTROL**
 Control Appliances/Devices through Voice -
 This project showcases a voice-controlled home automation system using the ESP32 microcontroller and the DFRobot Gravity Voice Recognition Module. 
 The system allows users to control multiple devices (like lights, fans, or appliances) using custom voice commands without relying on internet-based assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.

The Gravity Voice Module handles offline speech recognition, making the system fast, privacy-focused, and independent of cloud connectivity. The ESP32 processes the recognized commands 
and switches devices on or off via relay modules. This project is ideal for building low-cost, responsive, and internet-independent smart systems, and can be extended for use in home,
office, or assistive technology applications.
